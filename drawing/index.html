	  <p id="left" style="margin-right:13px"><strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> was a South Korean  illustrator, cartoonist, and manhwa artist. He is venerated as a legendary artist due to his incredible ability to produce detailed illustrations entirely from memory. His process was known for lacking the use of any sketches, visual references, or other preparatory aids. Jung Gi's photographic memory allowed him to be able to skillfully replicate many detailed objects, such as complex machinery and weaponry from his time in enlistment. Kim Jung Gi was born on February 7, 1975 and passed away on October 3, 2022, leaving behind an untouchable legacy in the art community.</p>
